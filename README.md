# A git prompt for bash

With `git-prompt` you'll _hopefully_ never find yourself again in the following **gruesome** situations:
- Resolving merge conflicts manually because you forgot to `pull` your branch.
- or even worse, `commiting` and `pushing` to the wrong branch :scream:

## Install
Easy to install, just three simple steps:
#### Linux
```bash
cd ~
git clone -q https://github.com/ezorita/git-prompt
printf "\nsource $(pwd)/git-prompt/git-prompt" >> .bashrc
```
#### MacOS
```bash
cd ~
git clone -q https://github.com/ezorita/git-prompt
printf "\nsource $(pwd)/git-prompt/git-prompt" >> .bash_profile
```

## Features
It's terribly simple:

### Autofetch
No need to `fetch` anymore. It will automatically `fetch` your current branch every 10 (default) minutes.

Automatically `fetches` when you `cd` to a git repository or change branch.

### Easy to turn on and off
Just type `GIT_PROMPT=0` or `gitpr` and _voil√†_, you're back to your default prompt.

Here is the alias definition, add it to your bash options file:

```bash
alias gitpr='GIT_PROMPT=$((1-{$GIT_PROMPT}))'
```

### Easy to customize
Just set the environment variables.
